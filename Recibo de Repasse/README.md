## Redibo de Repasse - Java Routine

This routine was created by me due to some limitations in my work, a Java Routine was 
the most effective way to solve a lot of problems.

With a query, the routine get data from a server Oracle Database and send each one as 
a parameter to a JasperReport report, then it can be generated for each client according their
specific data.

On this project was also necessary create directorys for each year and month to store each 
report.

Inside the server, the routine was configurated to run once in a month.
